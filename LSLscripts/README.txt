main.py ----- is just a generic little script that helps running mulitple scripts from
single window (by opening windows for you). Developed for windows so need to change/get rid of some
things to work on unix

recNSave.py ---- is main script, the rpyc lib is not needed and can be removed which would make the script much much
simpler. Run this along with dummyStream.py to see if it works.

Rest are just files that have been used to see functionality/test things
