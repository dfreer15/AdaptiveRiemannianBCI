# AdaptiveRiemannianBCI

Hello! After downloading and settling the dependencies, you should be able to directly run the adaptive_bci_func.py file to see how the adaptive BCI works. You will most likely have to change the data_dir (line 166) to wherever your code is.

Soon I will upload the code related to the training protocol (using PsychoPy)

If you use any of this code, please cite my paper, and other code that I used heavily (such as PyRiemann):

Daniel Freer, Fani Deligianni, Guang-Zhong Yang. "Adaptive Riemannian BCI for Enhanced Motor Imagery Training Protocols", IEEE-EMBS 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, 2019.
