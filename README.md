# AdaptiveRiemannianBCI

Hello! After downloading, you should be able to directly run the adaptive_bci_func.py file to see how the adaptive BCI works.

Soon I will upload the code related to the training protocol (using PsychoPy)

If you use any of this code, please cite my paper, and other papers that I used (including PyRiemann):

Daniel Freer, Fani Deligianni, Guang-Zhong Yang. "Adaptive Riemannian BCI for Enhanced Motor Imagery Training Protocols", IEEE-EMBS 16th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, 2019.
